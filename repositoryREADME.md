# <README Generator>

## Description

Quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows you to devote more time to working on your project.

This program is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). You can review the review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) to verify that this program has everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

## Installation

Once you are in a program editor, you will need to open the terminal in the specific index.js file, in which you will be using the program.
